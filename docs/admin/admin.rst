Admin
=====

The administration panel is used to perform high-level configuration and event
management for FLL Scorer. The high-level configuration applies to all events,
while the event/team management, along with the score/rubric management, is
used to setup an individual event and track/adjust its operation.

This is typically used by a key volunteer, such as the Tournament Director,
Head Referee, Judge Advisor, and so on, or their designee.
