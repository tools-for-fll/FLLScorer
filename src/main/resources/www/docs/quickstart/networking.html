<h1>Networking<a class="headerlink" href="#networking" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Computer networking/WiFi at an event can be easy or it can be really
challenging, depending on the venue and the equipment available to bring to the
venue.  Let’s look at two different setups:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#using-the-venues-wifi"><span class="std std-ref">Using the Venue’s WiFi</span></a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#setting-up-a-wifi-network"><span class="std std-ref">Setting up a WiFi Network</span></a></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>This guide presumes some knowledge and understanding of WiFi networks and
configuration.  Consult <a class="reference external" href="https://google.com">Google</a> or someone within the local FLL community
for assistance if necessary.</p>
</div>
<p>Whichever method is used to access WiFi, refer to
<a class="reference internal" href="#sharing-wifi-credentials"><span class="std std-ref">Sharing WiFi credentials</span></a> for assistance with getting devices onto the
WiFi network in use (especially important if referees are using their own
devices/phones to score matches).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>FLL Scorer uses a self-signed SSL certificate, which means that its validity
can not be verified by browsers.  Browsers tend to put very scary sounding
warnings when encountering self-signed SSL certificates (and rightfully so,
as on the public Internet that is a good sign that you’re about to get
scammed); in this case the browser should be told to visit the site anyway
(the mechanics of how to do this vary from browser to browser).</p>

<section id="using-the-venue-s-wifi">
<span id="using-the-venues-wifi"></span><h2>Using the Venue’s WiFi<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-venue-s-wifi" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The benefit of using a venue’s WiFi is coverage; it is a fixed installation
that has been designed and engineering to provide acceptable coverage
throughout the venue.  There are two challenges to using the venue’s WiFi:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Getting onto the venue’s WiFi network</p></li>
<li><p>Accessing a local peer computer once on the venue’s WiFi network</p></li>
</ol>
<section id="getting-onto-the-venue-s-wifi-network">
<h3>Getting onto the Venue’s WiFi network<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-onto-the-venue-s-wifi-network" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Depending on the venue, there may or may not be a public/guest WiFi network
available.  If one is available, getting onto it is usually fairly easy; one of
several methods are employeed by the venue’s network:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There is no password for the network, but once you connect it takes you
through a temporary account registration process.  The details of how this
works is beyond the scope of this document; there are too many different
schemes that are used by different WiFi equipment manufacturers!</p></li>
<li><p>The WiFi credentials are posted around the venue.</p></li>
<li><p>The venue personnel provides the WiFi credentials for use during the event.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, getting onto the venue’s WiFi network starts with a conversation
with the site coordinator, hopefully during the pre-event planning.</p>
</section>
<section id="peer-to-peer-access">
<h3>Peer-to-peer Access<a class="headerlink" href="#peer-to-peer-access" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once onto the venue’s WiFi, the next challenge is being able to perform
peer-to-peer communication.  In most/all schools, for example, peer-to-peer
communication is explicitly disabled on the WiFi networks (to prevent chatting,
cheating, bullying, and so on).  If the venue’s IT department is willing to
disable the peer-to-peer restriction for the duration of the event, that is
great!</p>
<p>If the venue’s IT department does not want to carte blanche enable peer-to-peer
communication, they may be willing to enable peer-to-peer on just TCP port
8443, the only port used by the FLL Scorer system.</p>
<p>If they are unwilling (or unable) to enable any peer-to-peer communication, the
only option is to bring in and setup your own WiFi network.</p>
</section>
<section id="downsides">
<span id="wifi-downsides"></span><h3>Downsides<a class="headerlink" href="#downsides" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>One potential downside to using the venue’s WiFi network is that teams,
coaches, spectators, and so on may be able to get onto the same WiFi network.
<em>Maybe</em> this is a good thing; they would be able to pull up the scoreboard on
their own device (assuming of course the scoreboard URL is shared!).  This may
reduce the crowding around the public scoreboard (but let’s be honest, isn’t
that part of the fun!).</p>
<p>However, if there are 100 team devices pulling the scoreboard, the extra load
on the scoring computer might cause problems for efficiently running the event.
Furthermore, a nosey child/adult may find their way into the login-protected
portion of the system, and may guess a password, or hack their way into the
system.  At which point they could actually change the outcome of the event.
Hopefully, Gracious Professionalism will prevail and this won’t be a concern!</p>

</section>
<section id="setting-up-a-wifi-network">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Setting up a WiFi Network<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-wifi-network" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Bringing your own WiFi network is in many ways easier, but requires more setup
at the start of the event and teardown at the end.  However, a big benefit is
the ability to set it up and test it ahead of time, prior to going to the
venue (in fact, the setup can be tested at the start of the season and simply
deployed at the events).</p>
<p>The big challenge with this approach is WiFi coverage.  If the pits are in the
cafeteria (for example) and the competition floor is in the gym, it may be
difficult (or impossible) to cover both with a single WiFi access point.  Which
means that either a scoreboard can not be displayed in the pits (which is not a
show-stopper, but it is usually nice to have a scoreboard in the pits) or a
WiFi mesh network would need to be deployed.</p>
<p>This setup covers using a single WiFi AP for the network; the same concepts
apply when using a WiFi mesh network (simply follow the the mesh setup steps
provided by the device manufacturer).</p>
<section id="configuring-the-wifi-ap">
<h3>Configuring the WiFi AP<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-the-wifi-ap" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There are two things that need to be done to configure the WiFi AP:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Set the WiFi SSID and password.  These are the credentials for getting onto
the WiFi network.  It is recommended to keep the credentials fairly simple so
that it not too difficult to get devices onto the WiFi network (though see
<a class="reference internal" href="#sharing-wifi-credentials"><span class="std std-ref">Sharing WiFi credentials</span></a> for how to make it simple).</p></li>
<li><p>Enable the 2.4 GHz WiFi signalling (likely referred to as 802.11b/g/n mode).
5 GHz WiFi signalling is great for high data rate or low latency needs (such
as video streaming or playing games), but the scoring system needs neither of
those capabilities.  It benefits much more from the longer ranges that is
achievable with 2.4 GHz signalling.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally, a static IP address can be configured in the AP’s DNS server for
the scoring computer with a host name of <strong>fllscorer.local</strong>.  If done, the
QR code links will all be <strong>https://fllscorer.local:8443/…</strong>, which is nicer
than <strong>https://192.168.1.42:8443/…</strong>.  The self-signed SSL certificate used
by FLL Scorer is for <strong>fllscorer.local</strong>, so it also removes one of the
certificate warnings from a browser (the browsers likely still warn about it
being a self-signed certificate).</p>
</section>
<section id="deploying-the-wifi-ap">
<h3>Deploying the WiFi AP<a class="headerlink" href="#deploying-the-wifi-ap" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The ideal placement for the WiFi AP is in the middle of the places where it is
accessed.  Take the location of the scoring computer, the locations of the
referees at the tables, and the location of the scoreboard(s) and timer(s); the
center of the smallest circle that encloses all of those locations is the ideal
placement.  This is easier to estimate than it may seem…pick the point midway
between the two locations that are furthest apart.</p>
<p>Stepping out of fantasy land into reality, it is rarely possible to place the
WiFi AP in that location (if nothing else, the chances of a power outlet at
that precise location is really small!).  Starting from that ideal location,
find the viable location that is closest to that location.</p>
<p>If a separate timer is used (in addition to or instead of a timer on the
scoreboard), it is probably better to disregard the scoreboard when placing the
AP (in order to get better coverage for the scoring computer, the referees, and
the timer).</p>
<p>Once the AP is deployed, test it out from the various places to ensure that it
is working well.  Be willing to move it if required to get good performance.
Placing the AP in an elevated place can help a lot; when it is low, the signals
have to travel through and around all the intervening people.  The 2.4 GHz
signalling used for older WiFi (which also has a greater operational distance
than the newer 5 GHz signalling) is very effectively blocked by water…and
people are 60-65% water!</p>
<p>The scoring computer can also be used to play music in the venue (it is already
connected to the sound system for playing the game sounds), in which case the
WiFi AP needs to be connected to the venue’s wired network to provide Internet
access (if using a streaming service such as Spotify).  This requires an
additional network cable running to the WiFi AP.  If the music to be played is
stored locally on the scoring computer, this requirement goes away (making for
an easier install).</p>
</section>
<section id="retrieving-the-wifi-ap">
<h3>Retrieving the WiFi AP<a class="headerlink" href="#retrieving-the-wifi-ap" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This may seem obvious, but if the AP is simply plugged into power in a location
away from the scoring computer (for example, to provide better WiFi coverage),
it is more easily forgotten during the cleanup process!  If the AP is next to
the scoring computer, this probably isn’t a concern; if it is located
elsewhere, it is a good idea to put a reminder on the scoring computer to
retrieve the AP!</p>
</section>
<section id="allowing-teams-onto-the-wifi-ap">
<h3>Allowing Teams onto the WiFi AP<a class="headerlink" href="#allowing-teams-onto-the-wifi-ap" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>It is possible to share the WiFi credentials and the scoreboard URL with teams,
so they can join the network and view the scoreboard on their own device.  This
has its dangers though, just like using the venue’s public/guest WiFi (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#wifi-downsides"><span class="std std-ref">Downsides</span></a>).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="sharing-wifi-credentials">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Sharing WiFi credentials<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-wifi-credentials" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../admin/config/config.html"><span class="doc">Config</span></a> panel has a WiFi “configuration” to assist
with sharing the WiFi credentials for the network in use at an event:</p>
<img alt="WiFi credentials entry" class="align-center" src="../_images/wifi.webp" />
<p>Enter the WiFi credentials (in this example, the SSID is <strong>fll</strong> and the
password is <strong>firstlegoleague</strong>) and refresh the QR code page.  The WiFi QR
code encodes the provided WiFi credentials; scanning the QR code on a device
brings up an option to join that WiFi network.  Super easy, no typing required
on each device that is added to the network (and more importantly, no
<em>mistyping</em> of the WiFi credentials on devices!).</p>
<p>This is the power of the QR code page; a volunteer can scan the WiFi QR code to
get their device onto the competition network, then scan their role-specific QR
code to get to the interface that allows them to perform their role.</p>
