  <section id="common-setup">
<h1>Common Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#common-setup" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>There is some event-specific common setup that must be performed, no matter how
the event is run.  Those steps are described here, and are a prerequisite to
the following quickstart guides.</p>
<p>If an event has already been run using the scoring computer, it is possible
that the first two steps can be skipped, and the <a class="reference internal" href="#create-the-event"><span class="std std-ref">Create the event</span></a> step
is the first that is needed.</p>
<section id="configuration">
<h2>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The first thing to do is some basic configuration of the scoring software to
match the region or event’s needs.  Start from the QR code page:</p>
<img alt="The QR code page, providing links to all the event tools" class="align-center" src="../_images/qr_codes.webp" />
<p>Click on the <a class="reference internal" href="../admin/admin.html"><span class="doc">Admin</span></a> QR code to access the admin page, bringing
up the login screen:</p>
<img alt="The login page" class="align-center" src="../_images/login.webp" />
<p>Log in as the admin user; the user name is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">admin</span></code> and the default password
is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FLLRocks!</span></code> (use the actual password if it has been changed!).  Once
logged in, click on the <a class="reference internal" href="../admin/config/config.html"><span class="doc">Config</span></a> button at the top:</p>
<img alt="The Config panel, showing the configuration settings" class="align-center" src="../_images/config.webp" />
<p>There are two configuration values that require attention:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Divisions</dt><dd><p>If the region uses a division model, division support can be enabled via
this checkbox.  Further configuration of the division is then exposed,
allowing the number of divisions, the division names, and the division
colors (in order to easily distinguish them on the scoreboard) to be
configured.  If the defaults are not suitable, they can be changed;
otherwise, no further configuration is needed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Scoreboard</dt><dd><p>To support having a single audience display, the timer can optionally be
displayed on the scoreboard.  By default, it is disabled, but it can be
enabled via this checkbox.  When enabled, the timer can be placed at the top
of the scoreboard (over the event name), making it easy to still see the
scoreboard; alternatively, it can be placed in the middle of the screen
(overlapping part of the scoreboard), making it easier to see the timer but
partially obscuring the scoreboard (only during a match though).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The other configuration options can be adjusted if desired, though it is not
necessary.</p>
</section>
<section id="select-a-season">
<h2>Select a Season<a class="headerlink" href="#select-a-season" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The next thing to do is to select the season (in the majority of cases, the
correct season is already selected, since the latest season is the default).
In the admin panel, click on the <a class="reference internal" href="../admin/seasons/seasons.html"><span class="doc">Seasons</span></a> button at the
top:</p>
<img alt="The Seasons panel, showing all the seasons" class="align-center" src="../_images/seasons1.webp" />
<p>Simply click on the desired season; it is highlighted, and it appears in the
status line at the bottom of the page.  The status line is always helpful to
ensure that the correct season, event, and number of teams are correct (in case
one of them is inadvertently changed).</p>
<p>Some seasons have alternate games/scoresheets.  In this case, the name below
the season logo is a dropdown selection; select an alternate game if desired
(the rules for the alternate games must be separately acquired!).</p>
</section>
<section id="create-the-event">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Create the event<a class="headerlink" href="#create-the-event" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The next thing to do is to create the event.  In the admin panel, click on the
<a class="reference internal" href="../admin/events/events.html"><span class="doc">Events</span></a> button at the top:</p>
<img alt="The Events panel, showing all the events" class="align-center" src="../_images/events1.webp" />
<p>Click on the add event <em class="fa fa-plus"></em> button in the lower right corner of the
page to add an event:</p>
<img alt="The add event panel, allowing a new event to be added" class="align-center" src="../_images/add_event.webp" />
<p>Enter the details for the event; the name of the event (for example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Kickoff</span>
<span class="pre">Spectacular</span></code>), the date of the event, and the number of matches in the event
(in most cases, it is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span> <span class="pre">w/</span> <span class="pre">practice</span></code>, which is a practice match and then
three official matches).  Click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OK</span></code> when done to create the event.  Then
click on the box in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Select</span></code> column for the newly created event to make
it the current event.</p>
<p>The status line at the bottom of the admin panel always shows the currently
active event, and can always be consulted to ensure that the active event has
not been inadvertently changed (which would cause confusion for everyone
involved!).</p>
</section>
<section id="add-the-teams">
<h2>Add the Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#add-the-teams" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The next step is to add the teams.  Depending on previous uses of the computer,
some or all of the teams at the event may already be entered (for example, at
a championship event where all the teams have previously competed at a
qualifier event).  Or, they may all need to be entered.  Start by clicking on
the <a class="reference internal" href="../admin/teams/teams.html"><span class="doc">Teams</span></a> button at the top of the admin panel:</p>
<img alt="The teams panel, showing all the teams" class="align-center" src="../_images/teams1.webp" />
<p>Teams can be entered in one of two way:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Teams can be individually entered by clicking on the add team <em class="fa fa-plus"></em>
button in the lower right, bring up the add team dialog:</p>
<img alt="The add team panel, allowing a new team to be added" class="align-center" src="../_images/add_team.webp" />
<p>Enter the team number, team name, and their division (if divisions are
enabled; the division select does not appear when divisions are disabled).
Click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OK</span></code> when done to add them.  After returning to the list of
teams, the square under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">At</span> <span class="pre">Event</span></code> column must be checked to add them
to the currently selected event.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Teams can be bulk added via a CSV file by clicking on the upload
<em class="fa fa-upload"></em> button in the lower right.  The CSV file must contain at least
a team number column (labeled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">number</span></code>) and a team name column (labeled
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">name</span></code>); and must also have a division column (labeled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">division</span></code>) if
divisions are enabled.  As an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">name</span>
<span class="mi">37350</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Bricks r&#39; Us&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">43157</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Motors of Mayhem&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">47654</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;LEGO Legion&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">52528</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Friends of LEGO&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">53342</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;We V3&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">55578</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Crazy Gyros&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">55699</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Block Stars&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">57773</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Blockenspiel&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">57873</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Beams &amp; Axles&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">58405</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Snapped Together&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">63979</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Spike Storms&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">64057</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;Gearheads&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This adds twelve teams to the event.  The columns in the CSV can be in any
order, and additional columns are ignored.  The names of the columns must
match these labels, but can be capitalized in any manner.</p>
<p>When adding teams via a CSV file, they are all added to the current event
automatically.  If the team already exists, it is simply added to the
current event, so it is safe to re-upload the CSV file (for example if there
are any late additions to the event, and a master CSV is updated).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="showing-the-scoreboard">
<h2>Showing the Scoreboard<a class="headerlink" href="#showing-the-scoreboard" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In order to show the scoreboard, start from the QR code page:</p>
<img alt="The QR code page, providing links to all the event tools" class="align-center" src="../_images/qr_codes.webp" />
<p>Click on the <a class="reference internal" href="../scoreboard/scoreboard.html"><span class="doc">Scoreboard</span></a> QR code to bring up the
scoreboard.  Alternatively, as would happen if a different computer is being
used to display the scoreboard, the URL under the QR code can be typed into the
browser on the other computer.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If using a different computer, additional steps may be needed to ensure that
there is a network connection between the two computers so that they can
communicate; see <a class="reference internal" href="networking.html"><span class="doc">Networking</span></a> for details.</p>
</div>
<img alt="The scoreboard display" class="align-center" src="../_images/scoreboard1.webp" />
<p>This page displays the current scoreboard.  Eight teams are displayed at a
time, periodically updating to the next eight teams and wrapping back to the
start after the final teams are displayed.  New scores do not appear on the
scoreboard until it starts the cycle back over at the first team, which may add
to the suspense of teams waiting to see their score!  If divisions are enabled,
the scoreboard cycles through the score for the divisions in order (in other
words, the first division, then the second division, and so on).</p>
<p>This is a display-only page, so it is safe to have out where participants may
be able to access it (though hopefully they demonstrate good Gracious
Professionalism and leave it alone!).  It is also worth noting that no game
sounds are produced by the scoreboard page (even when the timer is enabled);
they are only played on the computer that runs the main application.</p>
<p>Once the scoreboard is displayed and moved to the appropriate screen (for
example, if a secondary output from the comptuer is being used to display the
scoreboard), pressing <em>Ctrl-F</em> when the scoreboard window is selected makes the
scoreboard be fullscreen.  This hides the window decorations, tool bars, and so
on, so that just the scoreboard is visible.  Pressing <em>Escape</em> or <em>Ctrl-F</em>
leaves fullscreen mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="showing-the-timer">
<h2>Showing the Timer<a class="headerlink" href="#showing-the-timer" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If the scoreboard is configured to show the timer, it is likely that this step
can be skipped!  If, however, a separate timer is being displayed (either in
conjunction with a timer on the scoreboard, or instead of a timer on the
scoreboard), the timer needs to be displayed.</p>
<p>Like showing the scoreboard, start from the QR code page:</p>
<img alt="The QR code page, providing links to all the event tools" class="align-center" src="../_images/qr_codes.webp" />
<p>Click on the <a class="reference internal" href="../timer/timer.html"><span class="doc">Timer</span></a> QR code to bring up the timer.
Alternatively, especially if a different computer is being used to display the
timer, the URL under the QR code can be typed into the browser on the other
computer.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The same network connection requirement exists here!</p>
</div>
<img alt="The timer page" class="align-center" src="../_images/timer.webp" />
<p>This page displays the current state of the timer.  It is a display-only page,
so it is safe to have out where participants maybe able to access it (though
hopefully they demonstrate good Gracious Professionalism and leave it alone!).
It is also worth noting that no game sounds are produced by the timer page;
they are only played on the computer that runs the main application.</p>
<p>Once the timer is displayed and moved to the appropriate screen (for example,
if a secondary output from the comptuer is being used to display the timer),
pressing <em>Ctrl-F</em> when the timer window is selected makes the timer page be
fullscreen.  This hides the window decorations, tool bars, and so on, so that
just the match timer is visible.  Pressing <em>Escape</em> or <em>Ctrl-F</em> leaves
fullscreen mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-steps">
<h2>Next Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The next steps depends on how the event is being scored.  There are two main
