<h1>Events with a Scorekeeper<a class="headerlink" href="#events-with-a-scorekeeper" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Prior to the days of electronic scoring at the table, paper scoresheets were
used to capture the state of each match, and a designated scorekeeper (or
multiple scorekeepers at larger events) were used to calculate a score from the
paper scoresheet and enter it into the scoreboard.  Even with the advent of
electronic scoring, some regions still use this model, and it has some great
benefits (most notably the scoresheets can be given to the teams at the end of
the event, along with their judging rubrics, as a record of the event).</p>
<p>FLL Scorer supports running an event in this manner; the designated
scorekeeper(s) use a device (the computer that is running FLL Scorer, another
computer, a tablet, and so on) to transcribe the scoresheets into the page
intended for referees.</p>
<p>This guide provides the quick step-by-step process of setting up an event to
run this way.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>Remember that this depends on the <a class="reference internal" href="common.html"><span class="doc">Common Setup</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<section id="adding-users">
<h2>Adding Users<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-users" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>It is not strictly necessary to add users, as the scorekeeper can simply use
the admin user to perform all of their responsibilitites.  However, a user can
be added if desired (to reduce the permissions of the scorekeeper).  To add a
user, click on the <a class="reference internal" href="../admin/users/users.html"><span class="doc">Users</span></a> button at the top of the admin
panel:</p>
<img alt="The users panel, showing all the users" class="align-center" src="../_images/users1.webp" />
<p>Then, click on the add user <em class="fa fa-plus"></em> button in the lower right to add a user:</p>
<img alt="The add user panel, allowing a new user to be added" class="align-center" src="../_images/add_user.webp" />
<p>Provide the name for the user and the user’s password.  Click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OK</span></code> to add
the user, initially with no permissions.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If a user forgets their password, the edit <em class="fa fa-pencil"></em> button on the right
side of the user’s line in the list can be used to edit the user and change
their password.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the user is added, the required permissions must be provided.  For this
style of event, the Host permission allows the scorekeeper the ability to
perform all the required actions (add/edit scores, and run the timer).</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>The admin user must log out (the <em class="fa fa-bars"></em> button in the upper left, then
the logout button) and the new user must log in in order to complete the
reduction of permissions!</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="running-the-timer">
<h2>Running the Timer<a class="headerlink" href="#running-the-timer" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The scorekeeper usually also runs the match timer.  Go to the QR page and click
on the <a class="reference internal" href="../timekeeper/timekeeper.html"><span class="doc">Time Keeper</span></a> button.</p>
<img alt="The QR code page, providing links to all the event tools" class="align-center" src="../_images/qr_codes.webp" />
<p>This brings up the timer control page:</p>
<img alt="The timer control page, for starting and stopping the timer" class="align-center" src="../_images/control.webp" />
<p>There is only one button enabled at a time, based on the allowable action at
any given time.  Those actions are:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Start</dt><dd><p>This button starts the match timer.  Time starts counting down from the
match time (2:30 for the official game, though it may be different for
alternate games) as soon as this button is pressed, and the start sound is
played.  All other sounds (30 second warning and end of match) are
automatically played at the appropriate times.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cancel</dt><dd><p>During a match, this button cancels the match and stop the timer.  This is
only used in very extraordinary situations, and hopefully is never used at
an event!  The timer immediately stops (turning red), and the match canceled
sound is played.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Reset</dt><dd><p>When a match is over (either because the timer expired or the match was
canceled), this button resets the timer, preparing it for the next match.
The timer automatically resets 15 seconds after the match ends, so this is
only necessary if the timer needs to be reset quicker.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The majority of the time, the scorekeeper only uses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Start</span></code> button at the
start of a match (clicking it when the announcer says “Go” at the end of “3, 2,
1, Go!”, or whatever appropriate point based on how matches are started at the
event).</p>
<p>Typically, the scorekeeper keeps the timer control page in a different tab or
a different browser window.  When needing to start a match, they can quickly
change to the timer control tab/window, start the match, and then change back
to the tab/window where they are entering scores.</p>
</section>
<section id="testing-the-sound-system">
<h2>Testing the Sound System<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-the-sound-system" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Clicking on the settings <em class="fa fa-gear"></em> button in the upper left of the timer
control page opens the sound system test page:</p>
<img alt="Sound system test page" class="align-center" src="../_images/d_sound_test.webp" />
<p>The four buttons (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Start</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">End</span> <span class="pre">Game</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">End</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Cancel</span></code>) play the
corresponding sounds.  This is helpful to determine that the sound output is
making into the venue’s sound system, and that it is loud enough to be heard by
the participants (both volunteers and teams).</p>
<p>Once done, click on the close <em class="fa fa-times"></em> button in the upper right to close
the sound system test page.</p>
</section>
<section id="entering-scores">
<h2>Entering Scores<a class="headerlink" href="#entering-scores" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>To enter scores, click on the <a class="reference internal" href="../admin/scores/scores.html"><span class="doc">Scores</span></a> button at the top
of the admin panel:</p>
<img alt="The scores panel, showing the scores for the teams." class="align-center" src="../_images/scores.webp" />
<p>The teams are listed in team number order, making it easier to find the team.
Alternatively, the search at the bottom of the page can be used to quickly find
a team (by either their team number or their team name).</p>
<p>Next to each team, there are three buttons under each robot game round:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Edit / <em class="fa fa-pencil"></em></dt><dd><p>This allows the scoresheet for this round to be entered or edited.  It opens
a new window or tab (depending on the configuration of the browser) to view
and/or edit the scoresheet.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exchange / <em class="fa fa-exchange"></em></dt><dd><p>On occasion, a scoresheet is entered for the wrong team or round.  Instead
of re-entering the scoresheet for the correct team/round, this allows the
scoresheet (and score) to be swapped with another scoresheet.  It performs
an exchange; so it is safe to use if two team’s scoresheets were entered for
each other.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Delete / <em class="fa fa-trash"></em></dt><dd><p>This deletes the scoresheet (and score) for a team and round.  A
confirmation dialog ensures that the scoresheet should be deleted, and if
confirmed the scoresheet is permanently deleted.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>There is no undo!</p>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once a team is found, click on the edit <em class="fa fa-pencil"></em> button under the correct
match column to enter the team’s scoresheet for that match.  It opens a new
window/tab with the referee page for entering a scoresheet:</p>
<img alt="The scoresheet page, allowing the scoresheet to be captured" class="align-center" src="../_images/d_scoresheet.webp" />
<p>After making the selections for the missions, click on the Score button in the
bottom right (the Score button is not enabled until a selection is made for
each mission).  It either changes from <em class="fa fa-refresh"></em> to the match score,
or if there are errors in the selections, a popup indicates that there are
errors and error text appears below the mission(s) that are invalid.  In this
case, the match can be re-scored after the errors are corrected.</p>
<p>There are three buttons on the bottom left of the scoresheet page:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Discard</dt><dd><p>This closes the scoresheet, discarding changes (if any).  If there are
changes, a confirmation dialog ensures that the changes should be discarded.
If there are no changes, the scoresheet is closed immediately.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Save</dt><dd><p>This saves and then closes the scoresheet; the score is not published to the
scoreboard.  This is useful if there are questions about the scoresheet, for
either the head referee or the table referee.  The scoresheet can be saved
even if it is not fully filled out.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Publish</dt><dd><p>This saves the scoresheet, publishes the score to the scoreboard, and closes
the scoresheet.  This button is only enabled when the scoresheet has a valid
score (obtained via the Score button).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If a scoresheet is reviewed and changed (for example, if a team questions
their score and a mistake is found), the updated scoresheet must be
published again for the score to update on the scoreboard.</p>
</div>
<p>Once fully entered, the scoresheet should be scored and then published.  Then,
repeat for every scoresheet throughout the event.  Get a friend to help with
entering scoresheets and be sure to eat snacks and drink lots of water!</p>
<p>At the end of the robot game matches (and possibly before the end, typically
during the third round), the judges need a copy of the robot game scores and
ranks.  The download <em class="fa fa-download"></em> button in the bottom right corner of the
page generates a CSV file with all the teams, their ranks, score, and robot
game Core Values scores, and downloads that to the computer.  This provides all
the information that the judges need; provide this CSV file to them (thumb
drive, carrier pigeon, and so on…the details are left as an exercise for the
reader!).</p>
